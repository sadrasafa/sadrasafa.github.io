Hiya! I am a first-year PhD student in [KUIS AI Lab](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) at Koç University, working with [Asst. Prof. Fatma Guney](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/). I am interested in 3D computer vision and scene understanding.

 I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Koç University and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology.
